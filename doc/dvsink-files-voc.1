.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Record the output from DVswitch.  This will open a new file whenever
recording starts and whenever the Cut command is used in DVswitch.
The filename format may include formatting sequences as used by
\fBstrftime\fR(3) so that files are named according to the time when
they are created.  If the name format does not end with the suffix
".dv", this will be added.  Finally, a hyphen and a number will be
added before the ".dv" if necessary to avoid filename collisions.

.RS
Specify the network address on which DVswitch is listening.  The host
